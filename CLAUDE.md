# Tokyo by rail — Project Brief for AI Sessions

The standalone site for the Tokyo by rail project. Deployed on Vercel as a
static site from `main`. The related prior work is the Tokyo rail lines mini
app in the `tanishksharma/tanishksharmacom` repo (`/apps/tokyo-lines`): all 98
Greater-Tokyo passenger lines across 22 companies with official colors,
symbols and station-number badges, verified Aug 2026 against the line
articles on English/Japanese Wikipedia and the Japanese railway line-color
compendium (日本の鉄道ラインカラー一覧).

## Branching — NO staging, ever

This repo deliberately has no staging environment. This overrides the
staging-first workflow used in the other projects:

- `main` IS production. Vercel deploys it on every push.
- Every change, however large: create a feature branch, build on it, then
  merge it DIRECTLY into `main`. No intermediate branch of any kind.
- Never create, push to, or merge through a `staging` branch. If one ever
  appears, it is a mistake — say so instead of using it.
- Feature-branch previews (Vercel deploys every branch) are the only
  pre-production look.

## Stack rules

- Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. No frameworks, no build step, no npm runtime
  deps, no TypeScript.
- Styling comes from the Facet design system, loaded LIVE from
  `https://facet.tanishksharma.com/lib/facet.css` + `facet.js` — never
  vendored, never copied in. Component reference:
  https://facet.tanishksharma.com/llms.txt (source repo `tanishksharma/facet`;
  improve the library upstream, never fork it here).
- `vercel.json` ships every file no-cache (`max-age=0, must-revalidate`) and
  `cleanUrls`, so internal links are extensionless and every deploy shows up
  immediately.

## What NOT to do

- Do not add a staging branch or environment (see above).
- Do not introduce a bundler, framework, or package.json.
- Do not vendor the Facet library or pin its files locally.
